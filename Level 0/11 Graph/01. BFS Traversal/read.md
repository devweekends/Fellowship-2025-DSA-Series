## Problem: BFS Traversal of Graph

You are given an undirected graph with V vertices labeled 0 to V-1 and E edges.
Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node 0 and output the order
in which the nodes are visited.

Input:
- First line: two integers V (number of vertices) and E (number of edges)
- Next E lines: two integers u v indicating an undirected edge between u and v

Output:
- Print the BFS order starting from node 0, space-separated on one line.

Example:
Input
5 4
0 1
0 2
1 3
2 4

Output
0 1 2 3 4
