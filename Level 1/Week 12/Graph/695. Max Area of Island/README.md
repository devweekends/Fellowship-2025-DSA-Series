# Max Area of Island

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Description

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return *the maximum **area** of an island in* `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1
Input: grid = [
  [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
]
Output: 6

### Example 2
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Approach

This problem is similar to Number of Islands but we need to track the area:
1. Iterate through each cell in the grid
2. When we find a land cell ('1'), start a DFS to explore the entire island
3. Count the number of cells in each island during DFS
4. Keep track of the maximum area found so far
5. Mark visited cells to avoid counting them again

The key insight is to return the area from DFS and update the maximum area.
